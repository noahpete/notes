\chapter{Probability}
\section{Introduction to Probability}

We can represent a \textbf{possible world} using \(\omega \) where all possible worlds is the set \(\Omega\) . Thus, we can define total probability as:
\[
	\sum_{\omega \in \Omega } p(\omega ).
\]

We build machine models to predict outcomes based on data using \textbf{conditional probability}. In other words, we have probability based on some evidence. We can calculate conditional probability using the following formula:
\[
	P(a | b) = \dfrac{P (a \land b)}{P(b)}.
\]

\section{Random Variables}
In probability we define a variable with a set of possible values as a \textbf{random variable}:

\begin{definition}[Random Variable]
	A variable possessing a distribution of probabilities for various "states".
\end{definition}

\section{Baye's Rule}

From the above equation we have:
\[
	P(a \land b) = P(b) P(a | b) = P(a) P(b | a)
\]

\begin{definition}[Independence]
	The knowledge that one event occurs does not affect the probability of the other event. So we have
	\[
		P(a \land  b) = P(a)P(b)
	\]
	since \(P(b) = P(b | a)\) if \(a\) and \(b\) are independent.
\end{definition}

Thus, we can derive Baye's rule, which relates the probability of one event on the condition of another event, to the reverse relationship.

\begin{definition}[Baye's Rule]
	\[
		P(a | b) = \dfrac{P(b | a) P(a)}{P(b)}
	\]
\end{definition}

What Baye's rule allows us to do is that given:
\[
	P(\text{visible effect }|\text{ unknown cause})
\]
we can calculate
\[
	P(\text{unknown cause }|\text{ visible effect}).
\]

\section{Bayesian Networks}
There are a number of different probabilistic models. The first we discuss are \textbf{Bayesian Networks}.

\begin{definition}[Bayesian Network]
	A data structure that represents the dependencies among random variables. They have the following characteristics:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item directed graph
		\item each node represents a random variable
		\item arrow from \(X\) to \(Y\) means \(X\) is a parent of \(Y\)
		\item each node \(X\) has probability distribution \(P(X | \text{Parents}(X))\) 
	\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\incfig[0.3]{bayeneteg}
	\caption{A basic example of a Bayesian Network.}
	\label{fig:bayeneteg}
\end{figure}

We now aim to make an \emph{inference} using the Bayesian Network. Given the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Query \(X\): variable for which to compute distribution
	\item Evidence variables \(E\): observed variables for event \(e\)
	\item Hidden variables \(Y\): non-evidence, non-query variable
\end{itemize}
our goal is to calculate \(P(X|e)\).

\begin{problem}
	Calculate \(P(\text{Appointment} | \text{light, no} )\) 
\end{problem}
\begin{answer}
	Here, the \emph{evidence} is that there is light rain and no maintenance. The \emph{query} is the status of Appointment. The \emph{hidden layer} is the status of the train, since you are not given the train's status and you are not querying it; it's just a confounding variable. \par

	We note that
	\[
		P(\text{Appointment} | \text{light, no} ) = \alpha P(\text{Appointment, light, no} )
	\]
	and by the marginalization technique:
	\[
		=\alpha [P(\text{Appointment, light, no, on time}) + P(\text{Appointment, light, no, delayed} )].
	\]
\end{answer}
\begin{remark}
	The \textbf{marginalization technique} essentially states that
	\[
		\alpha P(Q,E)=\alpha \left[ P(Q,E,Y) + P(Q,E,\neg Y) \right] 
	\] 
\end{remark}

\section{Inference by Enumeration}
The above is an example of \textbf{inference by enumeration}. More formally, for the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \(X\): the query variable
	\item \(e\): the evidence
	\item \(y\): ranges over values of hidden variables
	\item \(\alpha \): normalizes the result
\end{itemize} 
we have:
\[
	P(X | e) = \alpha P(X, e) = \alpha \sum_{y} P(X, e, y)
\]

\section{Sampling}
Rather than attempting to calculate an exact probability, we can approximate a probability instead via \textbf{sampling}. By randomly generating samples for \(n = 1000\) or \(n=10000\), we can get fairly useful results. 

\begin{definition}[Rejection Sampling]
	\textbf{Rejection sampling} is the process of simulating numerous examples from a distribution while considering only the samples that possess the attributes of the desired query. 
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
	Rejection sampling is not particularly effective when the evidence you are looking for is fairly unlikely, since you are rejecting a lot of samples. This is inefficient since you are throwing away a large portion of your samples.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}[Likelihood Weighting]
	Rather than sampling everything, in \textbf{likelihood weighting}, we start by \emph{fixing} the values for evidence variables. We then sample the non-evidence variables using conditional probabilities in the Bayesian Network. Finally we weight each sample by its \emph{likelihood}.
\end{definition}

\section{Markov Models}
As opposed to assigning one random variable to a value, but rather an array of random variables to a value over a timescale. This leads to a lot more data, and so we must make some assumptions.

\begin{definition}[Markov Assumption]
	The assumption that the current state depends only on a finite fixed number of previous states.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Markov Chain]
	A sequence of random variables where the distribution of each variable follows the Markov assumption.
\end{definition}

For example, consider the basic Markov Chain
\[
	X_t \to X_{t+1}
\]
where \(X_t\) represents the weather today, and \(X_{t+1}\) represents the weather tomorrow. We can construct a \textbf{transition model} to describe the relationship as follows:

\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
		\hline
			 & \(X_{t+1}\): Sunny & \(X_{t+1}\): Rainy \\
		\hline
			\(X_t\): Sunny & 0.8 & 0.2  \\
			\(X_t\): Rainy & 0.3 & 0.7  \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The first line, for example, translates to "given today was sunny, tomorrow will be sunny with a probability of 0.8 and rainy with probability 0.2". We can refine our definition of the Markov Model further, by introducing \emph{hidden} states.

\begin{definition}[Hidden Markov Model]
	A Markov model for a system with hidden states that generate some observed event.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Filtering]
	Given observations from start until now, calculate distribution for current state.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Prediction]
	Given observations from start until now, calculate the distribution for a future state.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Smoothing]
	Given observations from start until now, calculate the distribution for a past state.	
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Most Likely Explanation]
	Given observations from start until now, calculate most likely sequence of states.
\end{definition}
