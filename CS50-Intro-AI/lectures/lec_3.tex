\section{Hill Climbing}
The most basic form of optimization we explore is that of the local search.

\begin{definition}[Local Search]
	Search algorithms that maintain a single node and searches by moving to a neighboring node.
\end{definition}

We can implement a local searching using \textbf{hill climbing} in which we do the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Check values of neighbors of current best value
	\item If a neighbor has a value closer to the desired value, set that value as current best
\end{itemize}

\begin{algorithm}[H]\label{HillClimb}
	\DontPrintSemicolon
	\caption{HillClimb}
	\KwData{problem}
	cur = initial state of problem \\
	\Repeat{better neighbor does not exist}{
		neighbor = best val neighbor of cur \\
		\If{neighbor not better than current}{
			\Return cur
		}
		cur = neighbor
	}
\end{algorithm}

The problem with this naive approach (\textbf{steepest ascent}) is that we may get stuck at a local extremum rather than the global extremum. Further, we may encounter a "shoulder", where several neighboring values are the same, and get stuck. \par

\section{Simulated Annealing}

Although there are a variety of hill climbing algorithms (stochastic, first-choice, beam, etc.). They have their flaws but the theme is that we never go from a good value to a worse value. Thus, we must overcome local extrema. We can tackle this with \textbf{simulated annealing}. 

\begin{definition}[Simulated Annealing]
	Simulated annealing is akin to a "cooling" physical process.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Early on, higher "temperature": more likely to accept neighbors that are worse than current state
		\item Later on, lower "temperature": less likely to accept neighbors that are worse than current state
	\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{algorithm}[H]
	\DontPrintSemicolon
	\caption{SimulatedAnnealing}
	\KwData{problem, max}
	cur = initial state of problem \\
	\For{\(t=1\) to max}{
		\(T=\) Temperature(\(t\)) \\
		neighbor = random neighbor of cur \\
		\(\Delta E =\) how much better neighbor is than cur \\
		\If{\(\Delta  E > 0\)}{
			cur = neighbor
		}
		with probability \(e^{\Delta E / T}\), set cur = neighbor \\
	}
\end{algorithm}

\section{Linear Programming}
In the context where we are trying to optimize for some function or when we have real values we are often trying to minimize or maximize a cost function given a variety of constraints. This is where \textbf{linear programming} becomes useful.

\begin{definition}[Linear Programming]
	Linear programming problems often entail the following:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Minimize a cost function \(c_1 x_1 + c_2 x_2 + \ldots + c_n x_n\)
		\item With constraints of form \(a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + \ldots + a_n x_n \leq b\) or of form \(a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + \ldots + a_n x_n = b\)
		\item With bounds for each variable \(l_i \leq x_i \leq u_i\) 
	\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{problem}
	Two machines \(X_1\) and \(X_2\) which cost \$50/hr and \$80/hr to run, respectively. We have the following constraints:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \(X_1\) requires 5 units of labor, \(X_2\) requires 2 units of labor per hour; we have total of 20 units of labor to spend
		\item \(X_1\) produces 10 units of output per hour, \(X_2\) produces 12 units of output per hour; company needs 90 units of output
	\end{itemize}
\end{problem}
\begin{answer}
	We can create a cost function:
	\[
		50x_1 + 80x_2
	\]
	and our constraints:
	\[
		5x_1 + 2x_2 \leq 20
	\]
	\[
		(-10x_1) + (-12x_2) \leq 90
	\]
	and then solve using a standard linear programming technique.
\end{answer}
