\subsection{Document Object Model (DOM)}
HTML tags form a tree called the \textbf{document object model (DOM)}: 

\begin{lstlisting}[language=html]
	<html>
	  <head></head>
	  <body>
	    ...
	  </body>
	</html>
\end{lstlisting}

The DOM is a data structure built from the HTML. In the DOM, everything is a \textbf{node}. All HTML elements are element nodes, with text inside HTML being text nodes.
